# 📊 Students' Social Media Addiction Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between student demographics and their social media usage using machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Project Highlights
- ✅ Performed data preprocessing: encoding, imputation of missing values.
- ✅ Applied **Backward Elimination** for feature selection based on p-values.
- ✅ Built a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict student addiction scores.
- ✅ Visualized platform-wise average addiction scores using **Seaborn**.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes attributes like gender, education level, device usage, platform preferences, and a final `Addicted_Score`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
- Identified key features influencing social media addiction among students.
- Random Forest showed good performance in prediction.
- Created clear visual representation of addiction across platforms.

## 📊 Visualization
A bar plot shows which social media platform is most associated with high addiction scores among students.
